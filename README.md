- ✌️ Hi, I’m Jeremy Shipman
- I love to learn about new things going on in the world of tech📱💻.
- I stay highly motivated and dream big🔬🚀. 
- I love to study new developments in code and am currently learning Swift and iOS apps. 

My biggest passion in life is to make cool things. 
When I was 7 my mom would give me two pieces of paper, a few paperclips, and a couple of rubber bands. A few hours later I would give her a racecar, a windmill, and a sailboat.
When I was in highschool I used my creativity for graphic design and made some innovative concepts come to life.
During college, I studied computer science in hopes that I could help make the world a more inspiring place through code.
